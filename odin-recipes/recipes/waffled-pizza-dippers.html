    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves</li>
            <li>2 8oz cans refrigerated crescent dinner rolls</li>
            <li>1 14 oz jar pizza sauce</li>
            <li>32 small pepperoni slices</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat waffle maker with 8-inch-square cooking surface on Medium-High heat setting.</li>
            <li>In medium bowl, mix both cheeses, basil and oregano; set aside.</li>
            <li>In 1 1/2-quart saucepan, heat pizza sauce over low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot. Place in small serving bowl.</li>
            <li>Unroll both cans of dough onto work surface. Separate each crosswise, making four (7-by-6-inch) rectangles; firmly press perforations to seal.</li>
            <li>Place 1 dough rectangle on bottom surface of heated waffle maker, being careful not to open up perforations. Quickly sprinkle 1 cup cheese mixture evenly on top of dough. Place half the slices of pepperoni evenly over cheese mixture. Top with another dough rectangle; close waffle maker. Bake 2 to 3 minutes or until sandwich is golden brown.</li>
            <li>With pancake turner, remove from waffle maker; place on cutting board. Cool 30 seconds before cutting.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining dough, cheese mixture and pepperoni.</li>
